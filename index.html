          This image doesn't load. The actual file has an uppercase file extension .JPG but you've pointed to 
          a file with a lowercase .jpg. Whilst this will work on your computer when you open the file in the 
          browser, it doesn't work on a server like that used for GitHub Pages because the server is 
          case-sensitive.
